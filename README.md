# Simple-E-commerce-site-with-native-php
# Getting Started
This is a small project i took up to get more familiar with php. This site was not built using any php framework,  i tried making this site using an mvc structure. It's not perfect in any way,but again ,it's a beginner project.

# Stuff you might need to know
The root directory is "Public", within it, there is the index.php, wich works as a bootstrap that has a functionthat loads the view and model of each page,which is in most cases stored in the link as a parameter.
